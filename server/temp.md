Let's break down this JavaScript code step by step:

```javascript
func()
function func(){console.log(23)}
func1()
let func1=()=>console.log(34)}
```

Here's what happens:

1. **`func()`**
* **Function Hoisting:** In JavaScript, `function` declarations (like `function func(){...}`) are "hoisted" to the top
of their scope. This means that the `func` function is defined and available *before* the first line of code actually
executes.
* Therefore, `func()` is called successfully.
* **Output:** `23` is printed to the console.

2. **`function func(){console.log(23)}`**
* This is the actual declaration of `func`. As explained above, it was already "known" due to hoisting when `func()` was
called. This line just formally defines it.

3. **`func1()`**
* **`let` and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):** Declarations made with `let` (and `const`) are also hoisted, but unlike `var`
or `function` declarations, they are *not initialized* until the line where they are declared is executed. Until that
point, they are in a "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ).
* When `func1()` is called here, `func1` exists in the scope due to hoisting, but it hasn't been assigned a value yet.
It's still in its TDZ.
* Trying to access a variable in its TDZ throws an error.

4. **`let func1=()=>console.log(34)}`**
* This line is never reached because the previous line throws an error, stopping the script's execution.

---

**Execution Flow and Output:**

1. The `func()` call executes successfully because `func` is hoisted.
2. `console.log(23)` inside `func` is executed.
* **Console Output:** `23`
3. The `func1()` call attempts to access `func1` before it's initialized.
* **Error:** `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'func1' before initialization` (or similar, depending on the JavaScript
engine).

**In summary:**

The code will first print `23`, and then it will throw a `ReferenceError` and stop execution.
